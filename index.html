                            <p>I went 17 Mile in 2016 Spring break. It's located around the Highway No.1.
                                Although it costs about two days to drive from San Francisco to Los Angeles, it's worthy.

                            <p>I went there in 2017 summer. It's the deepest and bluest lake in USA. I have to drive
                                from San Jose to Oregon first. The long trip is terrible but the beautiful scenery
                                is wonderful.

                            <p>Hawaii is a dream place for my husband and me. So we decide to go there for
                               honeymoon. We went to Honolulu and Maui. The Hana is a amazing place to enjoy.
